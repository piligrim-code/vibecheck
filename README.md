# Vibecheck
Description: This bot monitors the vibe in your chat and alerts administrators if it detects a negative vibe. It runs on ChatGPT technology and a PostgreSQL database, allowing it to analyze text with high accuracy and store chat mood history. ChatGPT analyzes messages for offensiveness and toxicity, and in case of detecting such messages, the bot sends an alert to administrators with the user and message details.
This helps create a more positive and friendly atmosphere in the chat, preventing the spread of negative and offensive statements.

Benefits:

Early warning of potential conflicts.
Timely assistance and support for chat participants.
Increased comfort and positivity in the chat.
Transparent statistics and bot settings management.


Features:

Determines the tone of messages in the chat using machine learning algorithms from ChatGPT.
